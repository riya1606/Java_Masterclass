// In this we learn how to declare variables in java. To declare a variable in java you need to mention the data type first followed by a variable_name that makes sense.

public class Variables {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
			
		int myFirstNumber=(10+5)+(2*10); 
		int mySecondNumber=12;
		int myThirdNumber=myFirstNumber*2;
		int myTotal=myFirstNumber+mySecondNumber+myThirdNumber;
		System.out.println(myTotal);
		int myLastOne=1000-myTotal;
		System.out.println(myLastOne);
	}
